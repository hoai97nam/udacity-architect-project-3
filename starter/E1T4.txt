Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3 should be used to simplify access to S3 resources from within a VPC. 
Prior to the introduction of endpoints, VPC resources had to go out to the internet to communicate with S3. 
This poses a potential security and availability risk, and complicates infrastructure architecture. 

# Poor practice 2
In the public subnet, for example, port 5000 is open to the internet while port 443 is not.
To prevent exposure to the internet, the instance should be in a private subnet, utilize port 443 rather than 80, and only permit access to port 5000 from the App Load Balancer SG.

IAM role could be used to access and change content in any S3 bucket.
