# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Disable SSH password login on the application server instance
- Update the security group which is assigned to the web application instance. Only allow connections to port 5000 from the public subnet where the application load balancer resides.
# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Implement least privilege access
    + The policy should be edited by limiting the access to only the free recipes bucket.
- Apply Default Server-side Encryption to the S3 Bucket
    + Server-side encryption could be enabled on the secret recipes bucket.  
    + We can set default encryption on a bucket so that all new objects are encrypted when they are stored in the bucket. 
    + The objects are encrypted using server-side encryption with either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
